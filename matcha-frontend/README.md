# FRONTEND CODE FIX

reset password section for frontend (checked)
email link change port: 3001 to 3000 (checked)
weighted profile suggestion for sorting and user suggestion (checked)
state not saved after filtering
placeholder for tag to exclude eg.
PUT api/user/location route. Error in updateUserlocation
when location is set to 0, 0 , backend will give error that longtitude and latitude are needed
backend not getting the correct ip for location
need to enforce that new user to enter location coordinate
online status either backend or frontend
blocked message log to be labelled
conversation needs to set max text
backend to check for blocked user and excluding it from the search
